# Pratidaan

**Give blood. See every life it touches.**

Pratidaan is an app for voluntary blood donors in India. A donation is split into parts (red cells, platelets, plasma) that reach different patients. Pratidaan follows each part and tells the donor when it helps someone, without ever revealing who. The same donation's sample doubles as a health check. Drop, Pratidaan's assistant, uses it to keep the donor well until they can give again, and a good health record can raise their health-insurance cover. Those are the reasons a donor comes back.

- **Live prototype:** Cloud Run service **`pratidaan`** in `asia-south1` (URL printed in the GitHub Actions deploy log; sign in with Google or **Continue as guest**)
- **Theme:** Sustainability & Social Impact (H2S × Google Cloud Gen AI hackathon)
- **Data:** entirely synthetic: 300 donors, 657 donation visits, 1,627 blood components and 8,541 lab results, generated with seed 42. Institutions, insurers and people are fictional. Nothing is sent to a blood centre, clinic or insurer.

## What a donor gets

1. **Their blood's journey.** Each component's path is shown from collection to the patient: an age band, the treatment and the type of hospital, released only when at least 5 patients share that description. When a part reaches a patient, Drop sends a short **Story** that ends on a shareable postcard. **Badges** record milestones ("5 patients", "Nothing wasted", "Helped a child"). **Circles** (family, workplace, friends) see what they have done together.
2. **Health between donations.** Drop explains each donation's results in plain words. A finding worth acting on becomes a **Goal** with one target and two or three steps, each citing the protocol or guidance behind it. Drop checks in every two weeks, offers check-up slots, sets reminders the donor asks for, and says when they can donate again. It sends at most one new Card a day and is silent at night.
3. **Better cover for staying healthy** (illustrative). Like a credit limit that rises with good repayment, the modelled health-insurance cover steps up (₹5 lakh → 6 → 7 → 8) at the same premium as the health score holds. It needs two monitored visits in 12 months and the donor's consent, and only the score is ever shared.

Around the donor: an **ecosystem view** (what all donors' blood did for blood centres, hospitals, labs and public health), guided **booking** with an optional Google Calendar event, and **Your data**, which shows everything kept and deletes any of it.

## Try it

Choose who to be in **Viewing as** at the top of every screen. The demo starts on **Saturday 10 Oct 2026, 8 am**. The yellow demo bar on Home moves time forward so Drop's behaviour over days and weeks can be seen.

| Persona | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **You (new donor)** | A new user with no records. Drop's eight-step **Intro** in Home's chat: language, how the blood's journey works, health between donations, your data, your Choices, when donating suits you. |
| **Arjun Rao** (B+) | **The main demo.** Gave blood on 3 Oct; his platelets reached a patient on 8 Oct. His results arrive on 11 Oct: BP 148/94, up at each of his last four donations (126 → 132 → 136 → 148). A Goal, *BP, blood sugar and cholesterol*, a demo check-up, a BP Check-in two weeks later, and the target reached. |
| **Meera Iyer** (O+) | Turned away twice for low haemoglobin (11.8; she needs 12.5). Her Goal is *Haemoglobin and iron*. Adding her sample lab report (Hb 12.6) clears her to donate again. |
| **Ananya Sharma** (O−) | Healthy, rare group, all 8 Badges, top cover (₹8 lakh). O− is short at her centre, so Drop offers slots. |
| **Vikram Gowda** (A+) | BP 184/118: an urgent Card that always sits first, can't be hidden and says to see a doctor today. His Goal suggests no exercise until a doctor has seen him. |
| **Karthik Menon** (B+) | Prediabetic HbA1c (6.1%), can donate from 3 Nov, no Cards today. What a quiet Home looks like. |
| **Rohan Verma** (AB+) | Hindi. One unit is withheld for safety with no reason shown; the counsellor contacts him privately. |

The team guide in [docs/drop/](docs/drop/README.md) has 20 click-through test scripts with expected results.

## Where AI is used, and where it isn't

All AI runs on **Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite on Vertex AI**. If Gemini isn't configured or available, every feature still works: each one has a rule-based fallback and says so.

| Feature | Where | What the model does |
|---|---|---|
| **Drop's chat** | Home, and the **Ask Drop** side sheet on every other screen | An agent with 18 donor-scoped tools: reads results, trends, impact, cover and Circles; shows a chart; offers check-up slots or a reminder; saves a BP reading; remembers a schedule or language preference; switches language; opens a screen. It answers in English, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu or Malayalam, in one or two sentences. In a Goal's Chat it follows that Goal's steps. |
| **Lab-report reader** | My health → Add an outside lab report; Meera's Check-in | Reads a photo or text of a report from any lab, maps test names to 16 LOINC-coded markers and converts units. The output is schema-checked and range-checked, and the donor confirms before anything is saved. |
| **The Intro in your language** | New donor, Home | Translates the scripted Intro the first time each line is shown. A translation is kept only if every number and placeholder survives. |

**Kept deterministic on purpose**, because these decide safety, money or privacy:

- donation eligibility (NBTC gaps and limits)
- clinical findings and their severity (ACC/AHA 2017 and ICMR thresholds)
- the health score
- Goals (grouping, target and order) and their written steps
- every Card Drop sends, and when
- the cover ladder
- Badges
- recipient privacy (k-anonymity)
- slot ranking

The model can't change any of them.

## Run it

**With Docker**

```bash
docker compose up --build
# open http://localhost:8080
```

**Without Docker** (Node 20+)

```bash
./run.sh                    # installs dependencies on first run, starts API + web app
# open http://localhost:5173
```

`run.sh` copies `.env.example` to `.env` on first run. For local use without the Google login page, set `AUTH_DISABLED=true` and `NODE_ENV=development` in `.env`. To use Gemini from a laptop, follow [docs/RUN_LOCALLY.md](docs/RUN_LOCALLY.md). Deployment is in [docs/CLOUD_RUN_VERTEX_SETUP.md](docs/CLOUD_RUN_VERTEX_SETUP.md).

## Architecture in brief

```
frontend/           React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Recharts: the donor app
backend/src/
  domain/           deterministic engines: health, eligibility, cover, impact (privacy), Circles,
                    Drop (Cards, budget, Goals), Intro, Stories, Badges, booking rank, concerns
  ai/               Vertex AI gateway (rate limit, daily budgets, traces), agent loop, 19 tools,
                    Drop's chat, lab reader, Intro translation, Card wording, home insight
  auth/             Google sign-in, guest sessions, Firestore records, "Your data" deletes
  booking/ calendar/  slot booking, Google Calendar event and Gmail confirmation
  data/store.js     in-memory store over data/synthetic plus data/demo, and the demo clock
  routes/           REST API under /api
data/               synthetic world (generate.py), demo overlay and seed, clinical protocols
```

One container serves the API and the built app. GitHub Actions tests, builds and deploys every push to `main` to Cloud Run service **`pratidaan`** (asia-south1) and removes the legacy **`tracedrop`** service. Full details are in [docs/03-architecture.md](docs/03-architecture.md).

## Tests

```bash
cd backend && npm test        # 152 tests: findings, eligibility, cover, privacy, Drop's rules, Goals,
                              # Intro, Badges, booking, sign-in, Your data, AI output checks
cd frontend && npm run type-check
```
