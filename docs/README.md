## What was removed, and why

The first plan (8–10 Oct) described a different product: a "navigator" from a health finding to care, with doctor and counsellor consoles, WhatsApp and voice, ADK agents, a FHIR store, BigQuery and Neo4j. It also quoted projected results (92% reaching care, 85% day-1 return, 0 vulnerabilities) that were never measured. Those documents were removed on 16 Oct because they no longer described the product, and several stated things the build does not do. They are in git history (`git log --diff-filter=D -- docs/`):

- `docs/archive/`: the first 5-phase build plan, phase reports, tech stack, implementation checklists, status and index files
- `docs/01-team-perspectives/`, `docs/02-user-perspectives/`, `docs/PERSPECTIVES_MASTER_GUIDE.md`: role and stakeholder perspectives written for the first plan
- `docs/05-strategy/`: consumer-positioning strategy and the lists of docs to update
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_HANDOFF.md`: the 11 Oct deployment checklist, now complete; its eligibility check moved to the submission checklist
- `docs/02-pitch/GENERATE-PDF.md`, `PITCH-DECK-VISUAL-GUIDE.md`: guides for the old deck
- `data/ontology/QUICK_START.md`: usage for a knowledge-graph client that was never built

The pitch and submission folders were renumbered `04-pitch/` and `05-submission/` to follow the three core docs.
